\title{Clean "by" argument}
\usage{
clean_by(by)
}
\arguments{
\item{by}{A character vector of variables to join by. Same specification as used in
\code{\link[dplyr]{mutate-joins}}.\cr
\cr
To join by different variables on \code{x} and \code{y} use a named vector.
For example, by = c("a" = "b") will match \code{x$a} to \code{y$b}.}
}
\description{
\code{clean_by()} takes a valid \code{by} input of a character vector (named or unnamed) and transforms
it into a list. Similar to \code{\link[dplyr]{common_by}} but does not require the actual data frames.
