Check out the [pkgdown](https://technomics.github.io/costmisc/) site to browse the features!

## Welcome to the costverse!

The *costverse* is a collection of R packages, inspired by the *tidyverse*. The goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem of R packages to streamline tasks encountered by analysts in the cost analysis profession. This can range from importing common data formats, working with difficult data structures (e.g., a WBS), or applying more advanced analytical techniques!

The *costverse* began as an internal [Technomics](https://www.technomics.net/) project to develop a set of tools that enable our employee owners to solve our clientsâ€™ problems more effectively. While aspects of the project remain internal, the following packages are currently available to the public. You are free to use them under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) - all that we ask is to please cite us as the authors.

 - [costmisc](https://github.com/Technomics/costmisc/)
 - [readflexfile](https://github.com/Technomics/readflexfile/)

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about what else is in the works!
