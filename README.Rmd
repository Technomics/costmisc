## Installation

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository into a working directory of your choice.

1.  Navigate to the directory with terminal using the `cd` command to where you would like to clone the repository too. The project will become a sub-directory of this location.
    -   `cd "your/file/directory/here"`
2.  Clone the desired repository from GitLab. Use the option to not check for the valid certificate (note the double hyphen in front of config).
    -   `git clone --config http.sslVerify=false https://gitlab.technomics.net/costverse/costmisc.git`

### Install Directly

The Technomics GitLab server does not currently support direct R package installation from source.
